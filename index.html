            <p class="text-muted">Good Experience Small beach but great fun Board the Ferri and enjoy the Scenic Dolphins on Cruise in Mandovi River. This is one of the best beaches to visit while in Goa....The water is crystal clear and it slopes down very gently me...Please be very careful regarding the Dolphin sighting and Coco beach.The organisers literally fool people and no Covid protocol was being followed ..The boats were stuffed with peope and people were made to sit in the boat for 3. -4 hours in the heat.The organizers had just 3 snorkeling sets and without disinfecting were making everyone use the same ,people are fooled about scuba also as hardly for a 2 min dip in water they charge Rs 1000.No formal training for scuba is done .The organisers make you sit in the wobbly boat till everyone in the boat finished their swimming and scuba which was very very tiresome.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">Went on a Sunday evening the place is nice , you can watch along the sea shore, plenty of boats around to go for sightseeing.Watch out for big boats as they will give you cheaper tickets but would make you wait until they have at least 20 odd people post which they would move..it was an amazing experience for me as i walked through the corridors thre were ferries and i was also able to see ships docked in the port.In the corridors ernakulam municipality has done a nice job by making seating arrangements for the fainted travellers to relax,you can sit there and listen to the radio music from the installed speakers in every tree top.overall a nice and promising experience.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">Water level was low when I visited. Still it was a good experience. The guides are friendly and professional. Reasonable rate. I am looking forward to visit again when water level is high.Coorg is really awesome place..full of natures , waterfall , views. I like river rafting and tracking on Hill and full of clouds n raining . It was amazing experience.It was my first rafting experience. we enjoyed a lot as we had company of friends. the instructor was great and instructed in english/tamil.Enjoyed the bumpy ride and flow of cauvery river. I went to this place with my friends ans I enjoyed a lot here . This was really cool. Overall nice place to visit. </p>

            <p>I watched it today with my Friends. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>It involves strong and often emotional dialogues, it shows Natasha and even Yelena suffering through trauma of their past, they stay strong with it all until they eventually break and share with their family. In the dinner-table sequence, the opening credits, and the gas station sister conversation, they let each other free up and let their buried thoughts free.Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff is as always, a strong, brave, humble-at-heart, touching character. Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova sets new ground, her character is naive and also humble-at-heart. The sisterhood between them touches your heart. Rachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff was pretty good too, she wasn't present for all too long but she made her impact as the mother well enough, she helps build Nat and Yelena as people with her quote 'Pain only makes you stronger' being continuously revised by them throughout the film. David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov (The Red Guardian) was quite a joy, he lightens up the movie right before it gets way too deep or emotional, he's charismatic with his role and keeps the mood up while also representing a bold, strong and fierce man, who eventually chooses to fight for his family as long as he could (fresh from prison, lack of physical activity and practice lead to weak stamina). Olga Kurylenko was an interesting choice for Antonia Dreykov (Taskmaster), she barely had an appearance, but she was part of Nat's past that troubled her, a past she seeks to (and successfully managed to) settle down and fix. Taskmaster's theme is DARK AND DEEP. It's one of the strongest villains' themes I've heard, it's threatening and dark, fits perfectly, and gives me chills with her suit and theme together. Would gladly love to see Olga as Antonia (Taskmaster) again in any MCU production.</p>
